              <p>We were asked to help the City of Pittsburgh better engage citizens with its memorial and public art programs -- sharing knowledge about those works and allowing active participation.</p>

              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5>How might we increase engagement around public art by creating a more dynamic and expressive experience for residents? </h5>
              <p>We recognized that one of the reasons why interest in public art is low is that people who have already seen the piece are less motivated to engage with the art when the content / conversation surrounding the public art is static. One way we thought to tackle this problem space was to encourage creative engagement and dynamic interactions.</p>

              <h2> Solution </h2>

            	<div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12"> 
              <p><b>Looking Glass is an interactive board </b> placed near a public art installation that viewers of public art can draw on to decorate the art, write on to interpret the piece or comment on others' drawings and to use to take photographs of the augmented view.</p>

              <p>It has four core pillars:</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> 
            		<h5>Transparent </h5>
            		<p>An augmented way for local residents to see through a lens where they can contribute to the art without modifying the original piece </p>
              </div>
            	<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            		<h5>Dynamic </h5>

	            		<ul>
	            			<li>Visited 3 installations and talked to 2 types of people: those who stopped by the art, and those who didn't</li>

                <p>Transcribed 8 interviews and grouped similar themes together. We found:
	                <ul>
	                	<li>People don't plan structured activity around public art; more an in-the-moment action than premeditated</li>
		            		<li>Engagement increases in areas with high foot traffic (i.e. bus stops)</li>
		            		<li>People believe that engagement can be passive  (simply noticing it in the background)</li>

                    <li>Incorporting different senses (i.e. audio, smell)</li>

                    <li>Incorporating social media was deemed distasteful and hand-held devices in general were seen as a distraction</li>
                    <li>Guided experience to approaching art (i.e. walkway/ viewer platform) intrigued people; serves as a short and low-effort activity</li>

                <h5>Think Aloud Protocol</h5>
                <p>Since allowing citizens to modify art installments most directly addressed the static nature of public art, we wanted to explore this idea further. Augmented Reality (AR) was identified as a potential tool that could allow anyone to easily modify the art, and we wanted to determine the suitability of AR for creating a new dimension for people to interact with public art 
                <ul>
                    <li>Explored WallaMe, an app that enables users to hide and share digital meesages that are embedded in the real world</li>
                    <li>Asked 6 people to 1) make a post, 2) react to a post, 3) find information from posts </li>
                    <li>Wanted to learn how quickly people learned to use the app, how many people could complete tasks, and overall, how interested they were in making & viewing posts</li>
                    <li>No one intuitively figured out how the AR part of the app worked; they did not understand that they need to explore their environment with the phone camera to discover messages</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                <h5>Revised Storyboard</h5>
                <p> Because none of the participants understood how AR worked, at least through a mobile app, we decided to simply take the virtual notion of AR and make it physical. Insights from the speeddating sessions also revealed that phones were generally seen as distractions from art, so this change was a step in the right direction. The new idea combined two concepts from the storyboards: that of a guided experience to approaching the art (i.e. indicating where to stand when observing the art) and the concept of soliciting reflections and contributions from passersby.

            		<h5>Experience Prototyping</h5>
            		<p>Tested our protoype to determine if people want to engage with public art and share their contribution. Our prototype is a stand with a clear acrylic board attached at eye-level. Itâ€™s placed in front of a public art piece and people can draw on the acrylic board to decorate the view of the public art.</p>

                <p>The stand includes a message to the user that invites the user to draw on the acrylic board and to, if desired, erase any drawings already on the board.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the stand includes instructions to the user on how to post his/her work to an Instagram account created by the research team. The account (@pghpublicart_innovation) is dedicated to participatory public art in Pittsburgh.
