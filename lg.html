              <p>We were asked to help the City of Pittsburgh better engage citizens with its memorial and public art programs -- going beyond sharing knowledge about the works and encouraging active participation.</p>

              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5>How might we increase engagement around public art by creating a more dynamic and expressive experience for residents? </h5>
              <p>Public art is integral to the identity of a city. From the Cloud Gate (i.e. "The Bean") in Chicago to Urban Light in LA to the Charging Bull in NYC, if someone were to visit the city but not take a photo with the art installment, they could even be questioned if they visited the city at all. Visitors love to tour all the famous statues and buildings, but what about the residents who provides the funds the city needs to support the arts? Residents have repeated exposures to these pieces, and because the content/ conversation surrounding the them are static, they have no incentive to maintain engagement with public art. One way we thought to tackle this problem space was to encourage creative engagement and dynamic interactions.</p>

              <h2> Solution </h2>

              <div class="col-lg-12 px-0">
                <p><b>Looking Glass is an interactive board </b> placed near a public art installation that viewers of public art can draw on to decorate the art, write on to interpret the piece or comment on others' drawings and to use to take photographs of the augmented view.</p>

                <h5>Think Aloud Protocol</h5>
                <p>Since allowing citizens to modify art installments most directly addressed the static nature of public art, we wanted to explore this idea further. Augmented Reality (AR) was identified as a potential tool that could allow anyone to easily modify the art, and we wanted to determine the suitability of AR for creating a new dimension for people to interact with public art 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Explored WallaMe, an app that enables users to hide and share digital meesages that are embedded in the real world</li>
                    <li>Asked 6 people to 1) make a post, 2) react to a post, 3) find information from posts </li>
                    <li>Wanted to learn how quickly people learned to use the app, how many people could complete tasks, and overall, how interested they were in making & viewing posts</li>
                    <li>No one intuitively figured out how the AR part of the app worked; they did not understand that they need to explore their environment with the phone camera to discover messages</li>

                <h5>Revised Storyboard</h5>
                <p> Because none of the participants understood how AR worked, at least through a mobile app, we decided to simply take the virtual notion of AR and make it physical. Insights from the speeddating sessions also revealed that phones were generally seen as distractions from art, so this change was a step in the right direction. The new idea combined two concepts from the storyboards: that of a guided experience to approaching the art (e.g. indicating where to stand when observing the art) and the concept of soliciting reflections and contributions from passersby.</p>

            		<h5>Experience Prototyping</h5>
            		<p>The stand had a rectangular cutout which allowed people to look at the art piece through the board. In the empty space, we placed a plastic sheet for people to draw on with white board markers. The transparency of the sheet allowed people to overlay their artwork onto the art piece without physically changing the public art. The design also uses black neutral tones to blend into the background and let users focus more on the public art. After testing it out on a few peers, we found:
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical board was way easier to interact with than the AR app</li>
                    <li>The plastic sheets were flimsy and hard to draw on; decided to replace it with a clear acrylic sheet</li>
                    <li>A lot of explaination was needed to describe what the board was for and how to use it; instructions were written and taped to the stand</li>
                  </ul>

                <h5>Observe and Intercept</h5>
                <p>We placed our protoype at the Agnes Katz Plaza to observe whether people would organically 1) approach it and 2) utilize it. We planned to stay at least 10 feet away from the board, and approach individuals only after they had already interacted with the prototype because we didn’t want to bias them.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                <p>The stand included a message to invite people to draw on the acrylic board and to, if desired, erase any drawings already on the board. It also directed them to Instagram, where we had created an account to share drawings and encouraged them to tag us in their own creations.
                  <ul>
                    <li>A handful of passerbys stopped to look at what others had drawn, and 3 people drew on the board</li>
                    <li>A resident who was on the clock stopped by to draw on the board; she expressed that she always looks for a way to contribute to the city that's "not defacing property" and that the project was "cool and different".</li>
                    <li>Few lookers expressed that wanted to participate, but didn't feel confident in their drawing skills and therefore only looked at others' interpretations</li>
                    <li>People were hesitant to erase other people's drawings; this also contributed to less engagement (e.g. they felt bad erasing a good drawing) </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

              <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 pt-3">
                <h5>Proposal</h5>
                <p>Although our prototype was fully physical, we think it would be beneficial to incorporate technology and make it a "smart board". Doing so would allow all interpretations to be screenshotted and saved, which would then be available for public viewing and reach people outside of Pittsburgh. This would also rid of people's reluctance to erase others' work, since it would be electronically saved and able to be recovered. Having a database of artwork also provides the opportunity for the board to act as a photobooth, where people can pull up their favorite interpretations and take a picture with it-- similar to how the couple utilized the board in the Instagram post. We believe that this idea has great potential in increasing engagement around public art, in a way that maintains interest even after repeated exposure to the installment.</p>
