              <p>Pennsylvania Prison Society (PPS) is a non-profit that advocates for incarcerated individuals by hearing their concerns/ problems (via "requests") and communicating their needs to the Warden. We were asked to help PPS in the development of a workflow system to be utilized by over 250+ Offcial Volunteers (OVs) across the state. </p> 

              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5> How might we streamline communication between the central office and regional chapters to increase transparency? </h5>
              <p> The organization has 43 chapters throughout Pennsylvania, and each functions differently due to various factors such as size of the chapter, number of requests, and relationship with the prison. Because of this, there isn't a standardized way for the central office to receive regular updates from individual chapters which hinders the organization from recognizing their impact as a whole.</p>

            	<h2> Solution </h2>
              <p><b>Render is a web-based request managing system </b> where requests can be uploaded and delegated to OVs, updated with actionable items post-visit, and analyzed to identify common problems and trends. To make visit reports as convinient as possible, we also <b> propose that an Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</b> be created. </p>

              <p>It is designed on four central ideas:</p>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> 
              		<h5>Central Hub</h5>
              		<p>A system that allows documents to be easily shared and accessed by chapters and the central office </p>
              	</div>
              	<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> 
              		<h5>Access Levels</h5>
              		<p>A required log in that indicates which features & information are relevant to the individual, based on their role in the organization </p>
              	</div>
            		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              		<h5>Request Analysis</h5>
              		<p>A summary of the type of requests the organization receives to notice trends of problems across the state to tackle systemic issues</p>
              	</div>

              		<h5>Semi-Structured Interview</h5>
              		<p>Learned how the organization functions, from the role of different stakeholders and the intake of requests
              		<ul>
	                	<li>Spoke to the Prison Monitoring Director and Director of Volunteers (also formerly incarcerated)</li>
	                	<li>Created a stakeholder map with color-coded relations to represent the different methods of communication</li>

              		<p>Synthesized information and visually represented the interactions between stakeholders, and identified pain points:
              		<ul>
	                	<li>Too many channels and methods of receiving requests (can't be helped)</li>
	                	<li>Results in requests getting lost due to numerous redirects</li>
	                	<li>Reporting request updates is confusing/complex, not always clear who to send it to</li>

              		<h5>Contextual Inquiry</h5>
              		<p>Shadowed OVs on their visit to a prison and observed a chapter meeting. Key insights include:
              		<ul>
	                	<li>There are two ways of delegating requests: based on the type of request, a volunteer of a specific demographic (i.e. profession, gender) will be assigned vs whoever has the capacity and can quickly address it</li>
	                	<li>OVs heavily rely on memory when discussing previous similar requests and their consequences, request history of a specific inmate, etc</li>

              		<p>Focused on the experiences of an OV and the prosses they go through when they are assigned to address a request. Identified more pain points:
              		<ul>
	                	<li>The prison restricts OVs from bringing <i>any</i> objects into the facility, which prohibits note-taking</li>
	                	<li>There isn't a database that can be used as a resource to look up relevant requests</li>
	                	<li>There isn't a standard report format, so OVs don't know what information to include </li>

              		<ul>
	                	<li>Analysis: the ability to filter through requests and analyze them and find insights and statistics</li>
	                	<li>Unification: documenting all intake and assignment of requests, and reports of visitiations</li>
	                	<li>Efficiency: simplify and standardize reporting, to make it as convinent as possible</li>

	                	<li>Ran sessions with the Prison Monitoring Director (forwards requests to specific chapters) and 4 OVs</li>
	                	<li>Received feedback that some individuals would wish to remain anonymous because some requests are very private matters</li>
	                	<li>Need to handle requests that are informational, and don't require a visitation</li>

	                	<li>Added column that indicates when the Central Office has seen the report, to assure OVs the value of their work </li>
