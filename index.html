              <p>We were asked to help the City of Pittsburgh better engage citizens with its memorial and public art programs -- sharing knowledge about those works and allowing active participation.</p>

              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5>How might we increase engagement around public art by creating a more dynamic and expressive experience for residents? </h5>
              <p>We recognized that one of the reasons why interest in public art is low is that people who have already seen the piece are less motivated to engage with the art when the content / conversation surrounding the public art is static. One way we thought to tackle this problem space was to encourage creative engagement and dynamic interactions.</p>

              <h2> Solution </h2>

                <h5>Think Aloud Protocol</h5>
                <p>Since allowing citizens to modify art installments most directly addressed the static nature of public art, we wanted to explore this idea further. Augmented Reality (AR) was identified as a potential tool that could allow anyone to easily modify the art, and we wanted to determine the suitability of AR for creating a new dimension for people to interact with public art 
                <ul>
                    <li>Explored WallaMe, an app that enables users to hide and share digital meesages that are embedded in the real world</li>
                    <li>Asked 6 people to 1) make a post, 2) react to a post, 3) find information from posts </li>
                    <li>Wanted to learn how quickly people learned to use the app, how many people could complete tasks, and overall, how interested they were in making & viewing posts</li>
                    <li>No one intuitively figured out how the AR part of the app worked; they did not understand that they need to explore their environment with the phone camera to discover messages</li>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                <h5>Revised Storyboard</h5>
                <p> Because none of the participants understood how AR worked, at least through a mobile app, we decided to simply take the virtual notion of AR and make it physical. Insights from the speeddating sessions also revealed that phones were generally seen as distractions from art, so this change was a step in the right direction. The new idea combined two concepts from the storyboards: that of a guided experience to approaching the art (i.e. indicating where to stand when observing the art) and the concept of soliciting reflections and contributions from passersby.

            		<h5>Experience Prototyping</h5>
            		<p>Tested our protoype to determine if people want to engage with public art and share their contribution. Our prototype is a stand with a clear acrylic board attached at eye-level. It’s placed in front of a public art piece and people can draw on the acrylic board to decorate the view of the public art.</p>

                <p>The stand includes a message to the user that invites the user to draw on the acrylic board and to, if desired, erase any drawings already on the board.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the stand includes instructions to the user on how to post his/her work to an Instagram account created by the research team. The account (@pghpublicart_innovation) is dedicated to participatory public art in Pittsburgh.

              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5>What information and features do people need to understand and improve their daily habits, sleep habits, and sleep quality? </h5>
              <p>There are currently a lot of different tools on the market for people to track and understand their sleep - to an extent. From a Fitbit on your wrist tracking your hours of sleep vs. restlessness to the Health app on your iPhone tracking your daily activity and sleep, these apps can tell you your sleep quantity and quality isn’t great but nothing on how to improve it. There are a lot of different factors that affect sleep, like caffeine intake, exercise, screen usage, and more, and by considering these alongside sleep quantity, we set out to build a tool that can help people understand and optimize their sleep quality.</p>

              <p>Pennsylvania Prison Society (PPS) is a non-profit that advocates for incarcerated individuals by hearing their concerns/ problems (via "requests") and communicating their needs to the Warden. We were asked to help PPS in the development of a workflow system to be utilized by over 250+ Offcial Volunteers (OVs) across the state. </p> 

              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5> How might we streamline communication between the central office and regional chapters to increase transparency? </h5>
              <p> The organization has 43 chapters throughout Pennsylvania, and each functions differently due to various factors such as size of the chapter, number of requests, and relationship with the prison. Because of this, there isn't a standardized way for the central office to receive regular updates from individual chapters which hinders the organization from recognizing their impact as a whole.</p>

            	<h2> Solution </h2>
              <p><b>Render is a web-based request managing system </b> where requests can be uploaded and delegated to OVs, updated with actionable items post-visit, and analyzed to identify common problems and trends. To make visit reports as convinient as possible, we also <b> propose that an Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</b> be created. </p>

              <p>It is designed on four central ideas:</p>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">

              	<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> 
              		<h5>Access Levels</h5>

            		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
