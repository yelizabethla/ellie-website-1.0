              		<p> For this project, we were instructed to create data visualizations with at least 3 different variables and incoporate information, story, goal, and visual form to aid viewers interpret data.</p>
              	</div>

                <p>The purpose of this project was to learn how to design and present information in a way that helps the viewer process and understand information at a glance. We visualized a system of connected data by parsing through a data set, and presented figures and illustrations in a way that helps users with the task of making comparisons & understanding causality.</p> 

                <h2> Background </h2>
                <p> I chose to delve into transportation— specifically, determine how often bike shares are utilized. In Pittsburgh where I attended college, there is a municipal bike share service provided by <a href="https://healthyridepgh.com/" target="_blank">Healthy Ride</a> that allows people to rent bikes for $2 per half hour or subscribe to unlimited half hour rides by paying $12 per month. Although in California (where I'm from) I used to bike frequetly, I found that I felt less inclined to bike in Pittsburgh due to the narrow streets, steep hills, and highly variable weather. Through this project, I wanted to learn how the popularity of the bike changed throughout the year, across different seasons.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                  <p>The first step I took in this process was to learn more about data visualizations in general, and how to effectively present data without "feeding viewers facts" like an infographic. To accomplish this, I found several illustrations and analyzed them to identify ways they were effective and limited.</p>
                </div>

                  <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">This is a visualization that I first saw in an HCI elective class, Sensemaking (05–499), that demonstrates the outcome of a Ph.D. and how seemingly insignificant it may seem in the grand scheme of human knowledge. Overall, this visualization is extremely clear to understand:
                    <ul style="margin:0px;">
                      <li>Students are required to take a range of classes until high school, which is visualized by the circle (even depth of all subjects) </li>
                      <li>In college, students deepen their knowledge of a specific domain, which is visualized by the red nub on the circle</li>
                      <li>As higher education is persued, the knowledge gets even more specialized, as it can be observed with the narrowing of the nub</li>
                    </ul>
                  A limitation of this graph is that it has no indication of how much time and effort is put into obtaining said knowledge, which, if included, could have contributed to the message of how difficult it is to obtain a PhD and break through the circle of “human knowledge”.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 pb-3">
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">This next example depicts the frequency, effect, and duration of each notable fire in California in the 2010s. This graph is effective in that the size and color of each triangle makes it easy for the viewer to clearly understand the general trend of fires. For example, just by scanning the graph, we can infer two things:
                    <ol style="margin-bottom:0px; padding-inline-start: 20px;" >
                      <li>The duration and magnitude of fires have been steadily increasing over the years.</li>
                      <li>Fires usually occur in the second half of the year — with most intense fires occuring in the fall.</li>
                    </ol>
                  An opportunity for improvement would be to include further data that helps explain the increase in wildfires. For example, showing correlation with yearly rainfall could help viewers deduce that dry soil aids fire.</p>

                  <p>The two sketches on the left show the use of shared bikes in a spatial way-- through maps. Since bikes are a method of transportation, I thought it would be interesting to determine where bike stations are and how accessible they are to residents of surrounding neighborhoods. I also thought mapping out different users’ routes would convey a unique story of which destinations are most popular and frequently used, to give off a sense of where Pittsburghers like to get around.</p>
                  <p>The sketches on the right is also based on the same idea; I wanted to determine which neighborhoods have the highest use of shared bikes, whether it is that the residents of this part of the city frequently use bikes, or that there are a lot of attractions in that area. After sketching, I realized that the graph that demonstrates the type of establishment (school, movie theaters, etc) users bike to and from to would be challenging to construct, since I would only be able to obtain information on which bike stations were used, not what the user’s final destination was.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12 pb-3">
                  <p>For these two sketches, I considered evaluating the relationship between temperature/ seasons with the use of shared bikes. Since Pittsburgh is infamous for it’s bipolar weather and people generally don’t like to bike when it is raining or snowing, I was curious to see if the weather actually affects how often bikes are used. I also thought it would be interesting to incorporate an illustration representing a bike in the figure, to emphasize the fact that the data has something to do with bikes.</p>

I obtained all Healthy Ride trip data in 2018 (bike ID, duration, station, user type), in addition to all bike stations in 2015 - 2018 (station number, location, number of racks), and Pittsburgh's historial bike lane data (year, location, length). I cleaned and explored all the datasets to find intriguing trends, and chose to utilize the 2018 trip data. From it, I found the proportions of users who pay a flat monthly fee ("subscribers") versus those who pay an hourly fee ("customers") and compared the differences throughout the four quarters. The data showed that more customers used Healthy Rides than subscribers in Quarters 2 and 3, and that the service was utilized more in general in these warmer months. The lack of overall use of the service in Quarters 1 and 4 and the majority of users being subscribers suggests that in the colder months, the resource is mostly used by subscribers out of necessity (e.g. commute).</p>

                  <p>This animation provided by bikePGH demonstrates the installation of bike lanes in Pittsburgh over the years (1983 - 2015). It shows the locations and lengths of bike lanes, and conveys the message that Pittsburgh has been transitioning into a bike-friendly city. This animation served as an inspiration for me-- how it represents the change of bike lanes over time through overlayed frames made it really easy to compare between different years. For my own visualization, I decided to highlight the difference of Healthy Ride usage throughout the year.</p>

                  <ul style="margin: 0px">
                    <li>Muted the map even more and repositioned the map to zoom into the intersection of the three rivers.</li>
                    <li>Each section of the left pie chart was labeled directly onto the chart, instead of indicating the colors on the chart title. </li>
                    <li>The right pie chart was partitioned to represent each of the seasons. Only one section would be highlighted at a time so that the viewer could readily compare the usage to other seasons without being visually overwhelmed.</li>
                  </ul>
                  Overall, this project was really interesting to work on! I never realized how challenging it is to clean up data and determine what factors will most effectively convey the message. As someone who initially came into college thinking of double majoring in Statistics, I truly enjoyed this project and had fun creating this data visualization.</p>
