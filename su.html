              <h2> Challenge </h2>
              <h5>How might we utilize data to help people improve their daily habits, sleep habits, and sleep quality? </h5>
              <p>Although sleep is essential for a person's health and wellbeing, research conducted by the NSF has shown that tens of millions of people are sleep deprived. Over the years, the number of sleep-tracking products have grown, but none of them help people understand how to improve their sleep. There is a need for a tool that goes beyond the generic tip of "minimize caffine intake" and "reduce blue light before bed", and help each individual understand what specific habits benefit their sleep. </p>

              <h2> The Project </h2>
              <p><b>SleepU is a sleep-intervention app</b> that uses Fitbit data and user-inputed trackings to provide personal sleep recommendations. These help users adjust their daily behaviors and sleep environment to optimize their sleep quality. </p>
              
              <p>It accomplishes this with four features:</p>
              <div class="row">
              	<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              		<h5>Habit Tracker</h5>
              		<p>A daily record of major factors of sleep (i.e. meal times, exercise, stress levels) to determine which combination of habits result in the best sleep for the individual</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> 
            		<h5>Sleep Decision Making Tool </h5>
            		<p>A machine learning model that predicts how an evening activity will affect an individuals sleep, and allows them to make informed decisions</p>
              </div>
            	<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            		<h5>Interruptibility </h5>
            		<p>An algorithm that determines how receptive one is to receive a notification based on phone usage (i.e. checking another notficiation, extensive use of social app)</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> 
              	<h5>Contextual Reminders </h5>
              	<p>A notification that gives a recommendation based on the time and location of the individual (i.e. if at a coffee shop past 3 pm, will remind them to buy decaf)</p>
              </div>
            	</div>

              

					<h2> Approach </h2>
            <div class="row">
            	<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            		<h5>Beta Testing</h5>
            		<p>28 college students participated in a semester long study. In the first 2 weeks, they only used a Fitbit to record their sleep data. Afterwards, they were assigned to either visit a health specialist who provided them with a sleep assessment and consulation, or used SleepU. After a month of the first condition, participants were assigned to the other conditions for another month.
	            		<ul>
	            			<li>Everyday, participants filled out a "Sleep Diary" where they logged habits that contribute to sleep</li>
	            			<li>Before and after each phase (4 times total), participants filled out a questionnaire that acccessed their sleep practices and other habits</li>
	            		</ul>	
	            	</p>
            		

            	</div>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                <h5>Semi-structured Interview</h5>
                <p>Interviewed half the participants from prior study and asked about their sleep during the semester.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Compared their sleep to other semesters, identified external factors beyond the study (i.e. class workload)</li>
                    <li>Discussed what factors they think affect their sleep, and any changes they made in their habit </li>
                    <li>Compared the two conditions: sleep appointment and using SleepU</li>
                    <li>Recounted their experience with SleepU; which recommendations they were following, and which weren't useful/ relevant</li>
                    </ul> 
                  </p>
              </div>

            	<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                <h5>Affinity Diagram</h5>
                <p>Transcribed 13 interviews and grouped similar quotes to find common themes. We found:
	                <ul>
                    <li>Overall, using SleepU was as effective, or better than visiting a health specialist</li>
	                	<li>Participants found the recommendations and habit tracking to be helpful; they became more conscious of factors that affect their sleep (i.e. many established a bedtime routine) </li>
                    <li>Many expressed that recommendations got repetivitive after a while. This was because after the model determined which habits work best for the individual, it would recommend the same ones to ensure that they were being followed. There is a need for people to mark which habits they reguarly practice without the help of the app, so that SleepU can recommend new ones. </li>
                    <li>Participants also shared that they wanted to learn more about sleep in general, and why specific recommendations improve sleep</li>
		            		</ul>	
		            	</p>

                <h5>Storyboard</h5>
                <p>Brainstormed ways we can improve SleepU based on user needs identified and specific feedback we received from participants during the interview. Ideas centered around two types of interactions:
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>App to person</b> (Storyboards 2, 3, 4): Make recommendations more specific and actionable (i.e. Contextual reminders through the use phone data, time, and location) </li>
                    <li><b>Person to app</b> (Storyboards 1, 5, 6): Visualize/ explain how actions affect sleep, help individuals make good decisions for their sleep (i.e. Decision making tool, habit tracker)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>
            	<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
              	<h5>Speed Dating</h5>
            		<p> Interviewed 8 new individuals; learned if people could relate to scenarios and if there was an actual need for the solution. Key findings:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Storyboard 2: People know that it's important to have a consistent sleep schedule, but aren't always able to go to sleep when they want because they are finishing up work. In this case, a reminder from SleepU wouldn't be helpful</li>
                    <li>Storyboards 3 and 4 were liked better, since it's regarding something the individual has control over and preventing bad choices</li>
                    <li>Storyboard 5: Logging habits takes effort, and inputing data would depend on how motivated they are to improve their sleep</li>
                    <li>Storyboard 6: Depending on the importance of the morning plan, usage of decision tool would differ (i.e. if high stakes, would still stay in for mental preperation)</li>
                  </ul>

            <h2> Design Conference </h2>
            <p>In August 2019, we submitted our project to the <a href="https://centerhxd.com/collaborations/projects/health-x-design-building-health-into-everyday-life/" target="_blank">Health x Design: Building Health into Everyday Life Design Challenge</a>. For the submission, I created a 3 minute video describing our project, from the importance of our work and the functionality of SleepU.</p>
